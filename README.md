This Typing Speed Test is structured based on an algorithm inspired by the Human Benchmark typing test, which 
I recently used before this task. My experience with that typing test motivated me to code this program. I implemented modifications and improvements, specifically in steps 10 and 11, to enhance the user experience and ensure accurate WPM measurements.

1. Initialize a terminal standard screen for an improved user interface using Python's curses module.

2. Load a random line of text from the file typingtest.txt to serve as the target text for the user to type.

3. Display a welcome message and prompt the user to press any key to begin.

4. Display the paragraph and prompt the user to start typing.  

5. As the user types, overlay the current test on the target text in COLOR GREEN. If the user makes an error, highlight the incorrect word in COLOR RED to indicate that it needs to be corrected.

6.  Use Python's time module to track the user's typing duration 
Record the starting time when the user begins typing and the ending time when they finish.

7.  Capture and display the user's input in real-time. 
Allow the user to correct mistakes using the backspace key and display the corrected text.

8. Once the user finishes typing the entire target text correctly, the test ends, and the program stops tracking time.

9. Calculate the Words Per Minute (WPM) using the formula:
WPM = (characters typed/ 5) / (time elapsed in secs/ 60)
The average word consists of 5 characters. Since the time module records in seconds, dividing the elapsed time by 60 converts it to minutes for accurate WPM calculation.

10. Once the test is complete, prompt the user with the WPM and provide options:
Press any key to try again.
Press ESC to exit the program.

11. Reset for accuracy: After each completed test, reset the input and the timer to ensure accuracy in measuring WPM for each new test.
